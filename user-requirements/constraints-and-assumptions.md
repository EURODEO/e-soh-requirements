# Constraints and assumptions

The purpose of this sub-section is to document any limitations or assumptions that could impact the development of the system in order to ensure that the final product meets the users' needs and expectations. These constraints could include factors such as budget or time constraints, technical limitations, or any other factors that could affect the functionality or usability of the system. By identifying and addressing these constraints and assumptions early in the development process, we can minimize the risk of delays, misunderstandings, or unsatisfactory outcomes.
