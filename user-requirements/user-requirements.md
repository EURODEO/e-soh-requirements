# User requirements

## U01 - sub-hourly resolution observations from stations operated by EUMETNET Members

As a current, or new, data consumer of land surface observations,

I want near real-time access to sub-hourly resolution observations from stations operated by EUMETNET Members that are normally only made available hourly (or less frequently),

So, I can improve the services (including forecasting of fog and convective events) I provide to my users.
