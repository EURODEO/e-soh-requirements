## U01 - sub-hourly resolution observations from stations operated by EUMETNET Members

As a current, or new, data consumer of land surface observations,

I want near real-time access to sub-hourly resolution observations from stations operated by EUMETNET Members that are normally only made available hourly (or less frequently),

So, I can improve the services (including forecasting of fog and convective events) I provide to my users.

## U02 - sub-hourly not normally made available

As a current, or new, data consumer of land surface observations,

I want near real-time access to sub-hourly resolution observations from stations operated by EUMETNET Members that are not normally made available,

So, I can improve the services (including forecasting of fog and convective events) I provide
to my users.

## U03 - single unified view of supplementary observations following FAIR principles

As a data consumer

I want a single unified view of supplementary observations, that is easily accessible and findable, is easily integrated into my systems and can be re-used (i.e., following FAIR principles).

So, I can access data easily, especially across national borders.

## U04 - near real-time access to rain-gauge observations that aren’t normally published

As a current, or new, data consumer of rain-gauge observations,

I want near real-time access to rain-gauge observations, from gauges operated by EUMETNET Members, that aren’t normally published,

So, I can improve the services (including forecasting of fog and convective events) I provide
to my users.

## U05 - rain-gauge observations from 3rd parties

As a current, or new, data consumer of rain-gauge observations,

I want near real-time access to rain-gauge observations, from gauges operationally operated by 3rd parties who current make their data available to one or more EUMETNET Member, that aren’t normally published,

So, I can improve the services (including forecasting of fog and convective events) I provide to my users.

### Priority: secondary

## U06 - near real-time observations from personal weather stations

As a new data consumer of Personal Weather Station (PWS) observations,

I want access to near real-time observations from personal weather stations in a way that is consistent with other land surface observations made available via E-SOH,

So, I can improve the services (including forecasting of fog and convective events) I provide to my users and minimise development requirement in consuming data from a new observing network.

### Priority: tertiary

### Clarifications

### Acceptance criteria

### Consequences and decisions

## U7 - first iteration and subsequent corrections

As a meteorologist in the weather forecasting services,

I need access to the first iteration of the observations data, as well as late or subsequently corrected observations,

so I can always base my forecasts on the most reliable observations.
