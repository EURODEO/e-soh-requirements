== Dependencies

This chapter is meant to capture any relationships or interdependencies between different requirements. This information can be important for understanding how the system works as a whole, and for ensuring that each requirement is considered in the context of the broader system.

=== Relationship between B03, B12 and F23

Even though we would like it to be easy to join E-SOH (as a data provider), we need to make sure that there are as few as possible input interfaces and that the interfaces are simple and unified.

There is an inherent tension between requirement B12 (minimal changes for data producers), F23 (keep current data formats), and B03 (homogenous interface to data). We must consider trade-offs between these in the design/implementation process.
