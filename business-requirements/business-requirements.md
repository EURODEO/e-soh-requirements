## B01 - E-SOH to be a flexible pathway to exposing more near real-time observations

As a EUMETNET Member,

I want E-SOH to be flexible and be a pathway to exposing more near real-time
observations,

So, I can deliver a consistent solution and reduce development activity.

### Priority: secondary

### Clarifications

The expectation is for E-SOH to be focused on land and marine surface observations including rain-gauges. It is envisaged that meeting this requirement for other surface observation networks (e.g., radar) will be met through other EUMETNET initiatives.

* Documentation and education for members and other user groups are required to provide such pathway
  * Agreed. For RODEO, we only need to deliver the sub-hourly observations from Members' Automatic Weather Stations

### Acceptance criteria

### Consequences and decisions

Documentation and education for members and other user groups are required to provide such pathway.

## B02 - adoption of a "build and share" approach to software development

As a EUMETNET Member,

I want the adoption of a "build and share" approach to software development,

So, Members can efficiently and consistently develop national capability related to E-SOH and beyond.

### Priority: primary

### Clarifications

* The project description says that all software should be open-source.

### Acceptance criteria

Software is licensed with an open license, such as MIT, apache 2.0, or GNU GPL version 2.

### Consequences and decisions

We will use Apache 2.0 as default.

## B04 - sustainable service

As a EUMETNET Member,

I want E-SOH to be a sustainable service that considers the whole lifecycle of a system from design, development, operations to retirement,

So, I understand the total cost of ownership of the E-SOH service.

### Priority: primary

### Clarifications

It is understood that estimating the full operational costs, at the tender stage, is extremely difficult. Therefore, as well as an initial estimate during the tender phase, there is a requirement for a more accurate estimate to be produced during the initial operational phase (WP3). The fully costed estimate of the operational costs should include, for example, system life-cycling cost and reacting to emerging user needs.

* Is this just sustainable in the meaning of operating cost, not in the meaning of green computing etc?
  * There is a general requirement for all EUMETNET Programmes to "ensure that the environmental footprint of the Programme is minimised where possible." So, this should be considered also in the meaning of green computing.

### Acceptance criteria

### Consequences and decisions

## B12 - minimise the required changes in production systems

As a data producer,

I want to minimise the required changes in my systems prior to making data available to E-SOH,

So, the value of E-SOH, over developing bespoke capability, is realised.

### Priority: secondary

### Clarifications

### Acceptance criteria

### Consequences and decisions

We need to establish principles for when E-SOH requirements on, e.g., input data formats or interfaces can be changed to meet producer needs.
