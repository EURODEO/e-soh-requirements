## B01 - E-SOH to be a flexible pathway to exposing more near real-time observations

As a EUMETNET Member,

I want E-SOH to be flexible and be a pathway to exposing more near real-time
observations,

So, I can deliver a consistent solution and reduce development activity.

### Priority: secondary

### Clarifications

The expectation is for E-SOH to be focused on land and marine surface observations including rain-gauges. It is envisaged that meeting this requirement for other surface observation networks (e.g., radar) will be met through other EUMETNET initiatives.

### Acceptance criteria

### Consequences and decisions

Documentation and education for members and other user groups are required to provide such pathway.
