## B01 - E-SOH to be a flexible pathway to exposing more near real-time observations

As a EUMETNET Member,

I want E-SOH to be flexible and be a pathway to exposing more near real-time
observations,

So, I can deliver a consistent solution and reduce development activity.

### Priority: secondary

### Clarifications

The expectation is for E-SOH to be focused on land and marine surface observations including rain-gauges. It is envisaged that meeting this requirement for other surface observation networks (e.g., radar) will be met through other EUMETNET initiatives.

### Acceptance criteria

### Consequences and decisions

Documentation and education for members and other user groups are required to provide such pathway.

## B02 - adoption of a "build and share" approach to software development

As a EUMETNET Member,

I want the adoption of a "build and share" approach to software development,

So, Members can efficiently and consistently develop national capability related to E-SOH and beyond.

### Priority: primary

### Clarifications

The project description says that all software should be open-source.

### Acceptance criteria

Software is licensed with an open license, such as MIT, apache 2.0, or GNU GPL version 2.

### Consequences and decisions

We will use Apache 2.0 as default.

## B12 - minimise the required changes in production systems

As a data producer,

I want to minimise the required changes in my systems prior to making data available to E-SOH,

So, the value of E-SOH, over developing bespoke capability, is realised.

### Priority: secondary

### Clarifications

### Acceptance criteria

### Consequences and decisions

We need to establish principles for when E-SOH requirements on, e.g., input data formats or interfaces can be changed to meet producer needs.
