# Introduction

This is the Requirements Document for the EUMETNET Supplementary Observations dataHub (E-SOH). This document outlines the technical requirements and objectives for the development of E-SOH, which is a component of the Federated European Meteorological Data Infrastructure (FEMDI) program. The objective of E-SOH is to provide a sustainable and standardized system for sharing meteorological observations in line with the World Meteorological Organization's (WMO) Information System 2.0 (WIS 2.0) strategy and the European Union's (EU) regulation on Meteorological High Value Data (HVD).

This document is intended for the development team, stakeholders, and anyone interested in the technical specifications of E-SOH. It includes a detailed description of the system's functional and non-functional requirements, acceptance criteria, and risks.

We hope that this document will serve as a clear guide for the development and implementation of E-SOH and help ensure its successful integration with the FEMDI program.
